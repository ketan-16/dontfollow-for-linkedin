# DontFollow For LinkedIn

Userscript for LinkedIn to untick the "Follow [Page] to stay up to date with their page" box.

Annoyed with the "Follow [Page] to stay up to date with their page" checkbox while applying via Easy Apply? Just auto-remove it!

## How to Install

This is a userScript that will work with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/).

1. Install either extension.
2. Click on the "Raw" button on GitHub, and Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey should install it for you. OR go to the Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey extension, create a new script, and paste the script content from `script.js` into the editor.
